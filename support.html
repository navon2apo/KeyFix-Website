                <h3>How does KeyFix fix keyboard layout issues?</h3>
                <p>KeyFix uses a sophisticated character mapping algorithm to detect when text has been typed in the wrong keyboard layout. When you select such text and use our fix function, KeyFix automatically converts each character to its correct position in the intended layout.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>Is my data sent to external servers?</h3>
                <p>No, all keyboard layout fixing happens locally on your device. Only text you explicitly select for translation is sent to our translation service provider.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>Which languages does KeyFix support?</h3>
                <p>KeyFix currently supports keyboard layout fixing between English, Hebrew, Russian, and several other languages. For translation, we support a wide range of languages including English, Hebrew, Russian, Greek, Spanish, French, German, and more.</p>

                <h3>The extension isn't working on some websites. Why?</h3>
                <p>Some websites implement security measures that may prevent KeyFix from functioning properly. Additionally, websites with complex text input handling might not be fully compatible. We're constantly working to improve compatibility.</p>
